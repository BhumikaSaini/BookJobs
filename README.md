A few things to temporarily note: 

Since we are using platform build 24.0.1+, it requires JDK 1.8 instead of 1.7, which was required prior to Android Studio Installation. 

JDK 1.8, download link. 
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html

Target SDK will be 23 (6.0) or Marshmallow. 

Build Tool version 24.0.1
